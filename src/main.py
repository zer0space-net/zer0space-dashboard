"""FastAPI application: routes, middleware, startup.

Layout of this file, top to bottom:

1. helpers (error shape, JSON body parsing, auth guards)
2. middleware (security headers, sessions, CSRF)
3. public pages and the three unauthenticated POST endpoints
4. the authenticated API
5. admin-only routes
6. startup / lifespan

Two boundaries in here are load-bearing and worth being deliberate about when
adding a route:

* ``_require_session`` / ``_require_admin`` — a new endpoint is public unless it
  depends on one of them. There is no blanket "everything under /api is
  protected" rule, because /api/login, /api/setup and /api/register must not be.
* ``CsrfMiddleware`` — covers every state-changing request that carries a
  session. The three exempt endpoints are exempt because they run before a
  session exists; they are covered by ``samesite=strict`` and their rate limits.

Error responses always carry a stable ``code`` alongside the English ``error``
text. The client resolves the code through ``static/js/i18n.js`` into German or
English; an unknown code falls back to the English text, so a missed
translation degrades gracefully instead of rendering blank.
