# CLAUDE.md — zer0space Dashboard

Project context for Claude Code. Read this before changing anything in this repo.

## What this is

A self-hosted homelab dashboard for the zer0space Docker Swarm cluster. It provides:

- **Service launcher** — a tiled, categorised list of homelab services (admin-editable).
- **Cluster status** — Swarm node/service/task health, read through a locked-down
  Docker socket proxy.
- **Host metrics** — per-node CPU, RAM, disk and uptime, pulled from a global
  Glances service.
- **Backup status** — reads the per-node JSON files the node backup script drops
  into the shared storage directory.
- **User management** — multiple accounts with `admin` / `user` roles, invite-code
  self-registration, optional per-user TOTP 2FA, and admin-controlled account lockout.
- **Password vault** — per-user encrypted credential storage (see the security
  section below; this is the part to be most careful with).

It runs as a single container, one replica, behind a Cloudflare Tunnel.

## Tech stack

| Layer     | Choice |
|-----------|--------|
| Runtime   | Node.js 20 (alpine) |
| HTTP      | Express 4 |
| Sessions  | `express-session` (in-memory store, secret persisted in the DB) |
| Security  | `helmet` (CSP, HSTS), `bcryptjs` (password hashing, cost 12), TOTP 2FA + CSRF hand-rolled on Node's built-in `crypto` (no `otplib`/`speakeasy`) |
| Uploads   | `multer` (background images only, JPG/PNG/WebP) |
| Database  | PostgreSQL via `pg` — **no ORM**, plain parameterised SQL |
| Frontend  | Vanilla JS, no framework, no build step |

There is **no build step and no bundler**. `src/public/` is served as-is by
`express.static`. Do not introduce a frontend framework or a bundler without
being asked — the no-build property is deliberate.

There is **no test suite** at present. If you add non-trivial logic, say so
rather than silently assuming it is covered — this applies in particular to the
2FA/invite/lockout code added in the `feat: totp 2fa authentication` and
`security: complete audit` changes: it has been reviewed carefully but not
exercised against a running Postgres instance in this environment (no Node/npm
was available to run it here). Test the login → 2FA → recovery-code and
invite → register flows end-to-end before relying on them in production.

## Internationalisation (German / English)

The UI ships in both German and English, switchable at runtime via the DE/EN
toggle in the topbar and in Settings. `src/public/i18n.js` owns this and must be
loaded **before** `app.js` / `login.js` — both rely on the globals it defines
(`window.t`, `window.I18N`).

**When you add or change any user-facing string, you must touch three places:**

1. Add the key to **both** the `de` and `en` dictionaries in `i18n.js`. They are
   kept at exact parity — a key in one but not the other is a bug.
2. In markup, put the key in an attribute rather than hardcoding text:
   `data-i18n` (textContent), `data-i18n-ph` (placeholder), `data-i18n-title`,
   `data-i18n-aria`, `data-i18n-alt`. Leave the German text inside the element as
   the pre-JS default.
3. In JavaScript, call `t('key')` — never a literal. Use `t('key', { name })` for
   `{placeholder}` interpolation.

Server-side messages are **not** translated on the server. Every error response
carries a stable `code` (`res.status(400).json({ error: 'English text', code: 'PW_TOO_SHORT' })`)
and the client resolves it through `I18N.tError(data)` to an `err.<CODE>`
dictionary key. If you add a new error response, give it a code and add the
matching `err.*` key to both dictionaries. An unknown code falls back to the
server's English `error` text, so a missed key degrades gracefully rather than
showing a blank.

Two things that are easy to get wrong:

- **Markup built in JavaScript** (service tiles, user rows, vault entries) carries
  no `data-i18n` attributes, so `applyI18n()` cannot reach it. Those views are
  re-rendered by the `languagechange:zs` listener at the bottom of `app.js` —
  extend it if you add another JS-rendered view.
- **`#greeting` deliberately has no `data-i18n`.** `app.js` fills it with a
  personalised time-of-day greeting; adding the attribute would let `applyI18n()`
  overwrite it with the generic string.

The chosen language lives in `localStorage` (`zs-lang`) — it is a per-browser
display preference, deliberately not a DB column, so switching needs no round
trip and no schema change. The initial value falls back to `navigator.language`
and then to German.

## Database

PostgreSQL runs as a standalone container on **zs-state-01 (192.168.0.16:5432)**,
database `zer0space`, user `dashboard`.

This matters architecturally: since v3 the dashboard holds **no state of its own**.
Users, services, settings and vault entries all live in Postgres, which is why the
service can be scheduled onto any Swarm node instead of being pinned to one host.

- Connection config: `DATABASE_URL` wins if set, otherwise the individual `DB_*`
  variables (see `.env.example`).
- Password resolution order is **Swarm secret file → env var**: `db.js` reads
  `/run/secrets/db_password` first and only falls back to `DB_PASS`.
- Schema is created on first start with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`. There is no
  migration framework — schema changes go into that bootstrap in `db.js` and must
  stay backwards-compatible with existing deployments.
- `db.js` exposes helpers mirroring the old better-sqlite3 shapes:
  `db.query()` (run), `db.one()` (get), `db.all()` (all), `db.tx()` (transaction).
  Everything is async.
- The pool has an `error` listener for idle clients. Do not remove it — without it
  a dropped connection raises an unhandled `error` event and kills the process.

Some data is still on disk rather than in the DB, which is why the `/data` volume
is still mounted: `/data/background/` (uploaded images) and `/data/backup-status/`
(JSON written by the node backup script).

## Security — read before touching auth or the vault

**Vault encryption.** The per-user vault key is derived from the user's *plaintext*
password at login (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256, 600k iterations, per-user salt in
`users.vault_salt`) and lives **only in the server-side session** — never in the
database, never sent to the client. A stolen database dump alone therefore cannot
decrypt vault entries. Two consequences that are easy to break by accident:

- A user changing their own password must **re-encrypt** all their vault entries
  with the new key (`reencryptAll` in `routes/vault.js`, called from
  `/api/change-password`).
- An admin-forced password reset **cannot** re-encrypt (the admin never has the old
  plaintext), so it deliberately wipes that user's vault instead of leaving rows
  behind that can never be decrypted. This is intentional, not a bug.

**Two-factor authentication (TOTP).** Optional per user, enabled from Settings.
Login becomes two steps once `users.totp_enabled` is true: `/api/login` returns
`202 { requires_2fa: true }` with a *pending* session (only `pending2faUserId`,
not `userId` — `requireAuth` cannot be satisfied by it), then `/api/2fa/login`
verifies the code and promotes it to a full session. `totp_secret` is AES-256-GCM
encrypted at rest with a server-wide key (`getTotpEncryptionKey()` in
`server.js`, same Docker-Secret → env → DB → auto-generated priority as the
session secret) — deliberately **not** derived from the user's password like the
vault key, since verifying a 2FA code must not require the plaintext password.
8 bcrypt-hashed single-use recovery codes are generated at setup and shown
exactly once. TOTP itself is implemented from scratch in `totp.js` (RFC 4226/6238
over Node's built-in `crypto`) and the setup QR is rendered client-side from a
vendored QR encoder — see `src/public/vendor/` above — rather than pulling in
`otplib`/`qrcode` as npm dependencies: the algorithm is small and fully specified,
and this keeps the "no native runtime dependency" property intact.

**Invite-gated registration.** There is no open sign-up. An admin mints a code
(`POST /api/invites`, 192-bit random, single-use, expires) and hands it to the
new user out-of-band; `POST /api/register` consumes it. Invalid, expired,
revoked and already-used codes all return the identical generic error — never
reveal which, so a guesser can't learn anything from the response.

**Account lockout.** Separate from the short-lived in-memory IP+username rate
limiter: `users.failed_logins` is a persistent counter, and 10 failures sets
`users.locked = true`. A locked account fails login the same generic way as a
wrong password (the lock state is only ever visible to admins, in the user
list) — only `PUT /api/users/:id/unlock` (admin) clears it, there is no
self-service or time-based auto-unlock.

Other invariants:

- Every route after `app.use(requireAuth)` is authenticated; admin-only routes take
  `requireAdmin` explicitly. When adding a route, place it deliberately relative to
  that boundary.
- Every state-changing route (`POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE` under `/api/`) takes
  `requireCsrf` — a timing-safe double-submit-token check — except the handful that
  run before any session/token exists (`/api/login`, `/api/register`) or would
  create a chicken-and-egg problem (`/api/2fa/login`, since a wrong code must still
  count as a failed attempt). The frontend's `apiFetch()` in `app.js` attaches the
  header automatically; a new mutating fetch call MUST use it (or `vaultFetch`,
  which is the same function) instead of bare `fetch()`.
- All SQL is parameterised. Never build SQL by string concatenation.
- CSP `script-src` has **no** `'unsafe-inline'` — inline scripts are blocked on
  purpose. `style-src` does allow inline styles (metric bar widths set via
  `innerHTML`). Do not loosen `script-src` to make something convenient work.
- `FORCE_HTTPS=true` enables HSTS and `upgrade-insecure-requests`; it defaults to
  false so plain HTTP on the LAN keeps working.
- Passwords must be at least 12 characters — enforced in every path that sets one
  (change-password, admin create/reset, register), backend AND frontend.
- The last admin cannot be deleted or demoted, and users cannot delete their own
  account. Keep those guards.
- **Never commit secrets.** No real passwords, hashes, tokens or connection strings
  in this repo — `.env.example` is a template with placeholders only.

## Docker & deployment

- The image is built by GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/dashboard.yml`) on every
  push to `main` that touches `src/`, `Dockerfile` or the manifests, and pushed to
  `ghcr.io/zer0space-net/zer0space-dashboard:latest` **and** `:<git-sha>` (the SHA
  tag exists purely for rollback — redeploy a known-good tag if `:latest` breaks).
  Authenticates with `secrets.CR_PAT` (classic PAT, `write:packages`), not
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` — GHCR packages created outside the repo's own Actions run reject
  the auto-generated token regardless of the workflow's `permissions:` block.
- The Dockerfile is a two-stage build; the runtime image installs production deps
  only (`npm ci --omit=dev`). `better-sqlite3` is a devDependency used solely by the
  migration script, which keeps the runtime image free of a native build toolchain.
  Keep it that way — adding a native runtime dependency reintroduces python3/make/g++.
- The runtime container runs as the image's built-in unprivileged `node` user, not
  root, and defines a `HEALTHCHECK` against `GET /login`. Because of this, the `/data`
  volume (NFS-mounted background images + backup-status JSON) must be writable by
  uid 1000 on the export side — check this if uploads or backup-status start failing
  after a redeploy on a fresh export.
- `docker-compose.yml` lives in the repo root and is deployed as a Swarm stack via
  Portainer. It defines three services: `dashboard`, `socketproxy`
  (`tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy`, read-only, only SERVICES/NODES/TASKS enabled)
  and `glances` (global mode, host-mode port 61208).
- The compose file references the published image; it does not build locally.
- `socketproxy` stays pinned to a manager node — only managers answer `/nodes`,
  `/services` and `/tasks`.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env     # then fill in real values — never commit .env
npm start                # http://localhost:3000
```

You need a reachable PostgreSQL instance. Pointing `DB_HOST` at the real
zs-state-01 database works but writes to production data — prefer a local
throwaway Postgres container for development.

Since the frontend has no build step, editing anything under `src/public/` only
requires a browser reload.

## Conventions

- Everything in this repo — code, comments, docs, commit messages — is in
  **English**. The only German lives in the `de` dictionary in `i18n.js`, where it
  is data rather than code.
- Commit messages follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`).
- `'use strict';` at the top of every server-side module.
- Match the existing comment style: comments here explain *why* a thing is the way
  it is (especially the non-obvious trade-offs), not what the line does.
